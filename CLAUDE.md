# CLAUDE.md — Megadroid Claude Code Context

This file tells Claude Code what it needs to know to work on this repository
effectively. Read it before making any changes.

## What This Project Is

**Megadroid** is an open-hardware bipedal humanoid robot targeting hobbyist
ownership. The design philosophy is ASIMO/Hubo-class walking capability at
hobbyist desktop PC cost (~$800–1500), using 775 brushed DC motors at 24V,
high gear ratios, and ZMP-based balance control — validated by the Hubo robot
as an existence proof.

The project is developed by a single builder using a V-model-inspired dual-track
process (Product Track + Infrastructure Track). The current version is **v0.5.1**.
Completed stages: **P1** (Authoritative Design Definition) and **P2** (Kinematic
& Structural Validation). Active stage: **P3** (Simulation-First MVS Validation).

## P3 Active Work — Read Before Starting Simulation Tasks

**Simulation framework:** MuJoCo (installed: `pip install mujoco`).

**What exists and works:**
- `design/mass.yaml` — authoritative link mass estimates (8.90 kg total)
- `tools/generate_mjcf.py` — generates `simulation/mujoco/megadroid_mvs.xml`
- `tools/sim_load_test.py` — model loads cleanly (15 bodies, 11 actuators) ✓
- `simulation/mujoco/megadroid_mvs.xml` — full MuJoCo scene with dynamics,
  position actuators (kp=150), foot contact geometry, ground plane

**Where work stopped:**
`tools/sim_standing.py` exists but the standing test fails. Root cause:
joint position control alone cannot balance a floating-base biped — the pelvis
is free to tip in any direction and there is nothing correcting it.

**Decision required before continuing:**
Choose one of:

1. **Fixed-base static test** (simpler, faster): add a weld/fixed constraint
   from world to pelvis; verify joint torques and static load distribution.
   Rename to `sim_static_pose.py`. Valid P3 milestone on its own.

2. **ZMP ankle-pitch balance controller** (proper dynamic balance): implement
   a proportional controller that adjusts ankle pitch to keep computed ZMP at
   the target point (between feet). This is the real P3 deliverable for
   quasi-static walking validation. More involved (~1–2 sessions).

**Key file:** `tools/sim_standing.py` — geometry and initialization are correct;
only the control strategy is missing.

## Authority Model — Read This First

### Single Source of Truth

```
design/*.yaml        ← ONLY place where numeric values and design decisions live
```

All other documents are derived views or static artifacts. Never introduce a
numeric design value anywhere except `design/*.yaml`.

### Document Hierarchy

| File | Role | Edit directly? |
|------|------|---------------|
| `design/*.yaml` | Authoritative source of truth | **Yes — always edit here** |
| `SPEC.md` | Derived system specification | **No — rehydrate only** |
| `MECH.md` | Derived mechanical description | **No — rehydrate only** |
| `README.md` | Derived repository overview | **No — rehydrate only** |
| `BOM.csv` | Derived cost/parts list | **No — rehydrate only** |
| `simulation/urdf/megadroid_mvs.urdf` | Generated URDF model | **No — regenerate only** |
| `simulation/mujoco/megadroid_mvs.xml` | Generated MuJoCo scene | **No — regenerate only** |
| `PHILOSOPHY.md` | Static — project philosophy | **No — static artifact** |
| `PROCESS.md` | Static — workflow definition | **No — static artifact** |
| `REHYDRATE.md` | Static — rehydration process description | **No — static artifact** |
| `docs/P2_VALIDATION.md` | Static — milestone report | **No — static artifact** |

**`SPEC.md` is the highest authority for the MVS configuration.** `MECH.md` and
`BOM.csv` must never contradict it.

If you find a discrepancy between a derived doc and `design/*.yaml`, **the YAML
wins**. Fix the YAML; rehydrate; commit in that order.

## Authoritative Design Files

```
design/
  joints.yaml       Joint definitions, limits, nominal poses, MVS flags
  geometry.yaml     Structural constants (link lengths, shaft diameters, etc.)
  kinematics.yaml   Axis directions, sign conventions, angle references
  mass.yaml         Link mass estimates for simulation (nominal; verified in P6)
  actuation.yaml    Motor and drivetrain parameters (stub — not yet populated)
  power.yaml        Power system parameters (stub — not yet populated)
  .meta.yaml        Schema/metadata for the design directory
```

### Key Design Constants (do not change without an explicit design revision)

- **MVS DOF:** 11 actuated joints
  - Per leg (×2): `hip_pitch`, `hip_roll`, `knee_pitch`, `ankle_pitch`
  - Torso: `torso_pitch`, `torso_roll`, `torso_yaw`
- **Actuator:** 775 brushed DC motors, 24V
- **Control mode:** ZMP-based
- **Standard joint output shaft:** 12mm steel
- **Twin-rail inner face spacing:** 100mm (structural — matches Hubo-style)
- **HTD belt:** 5M profile, 15mm width
- **Double-shear bearing support** required at all joints; single-shear prohibited
- **Angle units:** radians in computation; degrees in human-readable documents

**The design is frozen.** Do not propose changes to DOF count, link lengths,
coordinate conventions, base frame, control mode, motor type, or sensor strategy
unless the user explicitly initiates a design revision.

### Coordinate Conventions (from `kinematics.yaml`)

- **Handedness:** right-hand rule
- **Axes:** Z-up, X-forward, Y-left (standard robotics convention)
- **Base frame:** `pelvis_center` — geometric midpoint between left and right hip
  roll joint centers, aligned with global frame in nominal standing pose
- **Rotation sign:** positive rotation is counterclockwise when looking along the
  positive axis direction (right-hand rule)

## Mandatory Workflow

### Before committing any change

1. **Edit only `design/*.yaml`** for any design change.
2. **Run preflight** — rehydrates docs, runs all validators, and shows what changed:
   ```bash
   python3 tools/preflight.py
   ```
   Or run steps separately:
   - Rehydrate: `python3 tools/rehydrate_all.py`
   - Validate: `python3 tools/validate_all.py` (runs `validate_geometry.py`,
     `validate_no_geometry_literals.py`, `validate_dof_consistency.py`)
3. **If URDF-relevant geometry changed**, regenerate and verify the URDF:
   ```bash
   python3 tools/generate_urdf.py
   python3 tools/verify_urdf_dimensions.py
   ```
4. **Commit YAML changes first**, derived docs second — never in the same commit.

### Commit order (non-negotiable)

```
Commit 1: design/*.yaml changes            ← always first
Commit 2: SPEC.md MECH.md README.md        ← rehydrated derived docs
Commit 3: simulation/urdf/megadroid_mvs.urdf  ← if URDF was regenerated
```

### Never do

- Edit `SPEC.md`, `MECH.md`, or `README.md` directly
- Add a numeric design value to a derived doc
- Commit derived docs ahead of the YAML that produced them

## CI

Two GitHub Actions workflows run on push/PR when design files, templates, tools,
or derived docs change:

- **`validate.yml`** — runs `validate_dof_consistency.py` and
  `validate_no_geometry_literals.py` when design files or derived docs change
- **`rehydration-check.yml`** — regenerates derived docs and diffs them against
  committed versions; fails if content diverges (timestamps are allowed to differ)

Both must pass before merging. If CI fails, fix `design/*.yaml` and rehydrate —
do not patch the derived docs directly.

---

## What "Authoritative" Means

A design decision is only authoritative when it is:
1. Written into `design/*.yaml`
2. Reflected in `SPEC.md` (via rehydration)
3. Committed to the repository

Conversational reasoning — including anything suggested in a chat session — is
**never** authoritative until it clears all three steps above.
