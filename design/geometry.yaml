    Geometry values in this file are considered stable for the Minimum Viable
    System unless explicitly revised via SPEC.md change control.

units:
  length: "mm"
  angle: "degrees"

conventions:
  angle_reference:
    default: "neutral_upright"
    description: >
      Zero degrees corresponds to the neutral upright pose unless explicitly
      overridden in a joint definition.
  coordinate_system:
    handedness: "right"
    vertical_axis: "z"

anthropometrics:
  thigh_length_mm: 300
  shin_length_mm: 300
  ankle_to_sole_offset_mm: 80
  notes: >
    Segment lengths are center-to-center joint distances and exclude joint
    housing thickness and end-effector stackups.

leg_structure:
  twin_rail:
    inner_face_spacing_mm: 100
    rationale: >
      Matches Hubo-style twin-rail spacing to provide high bending stiffness,
      clear load paths, and compatibility with box-bulkhead construction.

joints:
  shafting:
    standard_diameter_mm: 12
    material: "steel"
    rationale: >
      Standard shaft diameter used for all primary joint outputs to simplify
      bearing selection, hub design, and pulley bores.

  bearing_support:
    preferred_configuration: "double_shear"
    allow_single_shear: false

transmission:
  belts:
    standard:
      type: "HTD"
      pitch_mm: 5
      width_mm: 15
      rationale: >
        Single standardized belt pitch and width used across all joints to
        minimize part variety, simplify sourcing, and improve serviceability.

lower_leg_module:
  interface:
    knee_to_module:

        ankle_actuated: false
      future:
        ankle_pitch_supported: true
        ankle_roll_supported: true
  notes: >
    Lower-leg modules are swappable without redesigning pelvis, thigh, or knee
    assemblies.

foot_stack:
  order:
    - knee_output
    - lower_leg_module
    - ft_sensor
    - foot
  constraints:
    ft_sensor_load_path: "axial_only"
    bending_moments_allowed: false
  notes: >
    Stack order and constraints ensure force/torque sensors are not subjected
    to parasitic bending moments.

end_of_limb_sensing:
  ft_sensor:
    form_factor:
      shape: "cylindrical"
      diameter_mm: 107
      height_mm: 56
    mechanical_constraint: "hard"
    cost_accounting: "excluded"
    notes: >
      Sensor geometry is treated as a fixed mechanical constraint and must be
      accommodated by the ankle and foot interface design.

torso:
  structure:
    role: "primary load path between legs"
    stiffness_requirement:
      description: >
        Structural stiffness must be sufficient to prevent measurable coupling
        between left and right leg motions during quasi-static gait.
